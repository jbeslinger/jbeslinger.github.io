		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<!-- Pretty self explanatory; copy this line for each ingredient; the 'data-unit' is always singular -->
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="" data-unit="">3 cups</span> all-purpose flour</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="" data-unit="">1 3/4 cups</span> powdered sugar</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="" data-unit="">1 tablespoon</span> black tea leaves, crushed</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="" data-unit="">1/2 teaspoon</span> salt</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="" data-unit="">1</span> orange, zested and juiced</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="" data-unit="">1 cup</span> olive oil</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>In a medium bowl or stand mixer, add the flour, 1 1/4 cups powdered sugar, tea leaves, salt, and the orange zest and two tablespoons juice. Stir to combine.</li>
			<li>Slowly pour in the olive oil while stirring. Continue to stir until the olive oil is incorporated and a soft dough forms.</li>
			<li>Split the dough into two equal parts and roll into 2" thick logs. Wrap each log in a piece of parchment or wax paper. Place in the freezer and refrigerate for at least one hour.</li>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 350ยบ F. Line a baking sheet with parchment.</li>
			<li>Unwrap the logs of dough and slice 1/2" thick discs. Place the discs 2" apart on the baking sheet.</li>
			<li>Bake for 18 minutes until the bottoms are just turning golden.</li>
			<li>Remove the cookies from the oven and place on a baking rack to cool completely.</li>
			<li>Once the cookies have cooled, mix together the remaining powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon of the orange juice. Add more orange juice until a thick and smooth consistency is reached.</li>
			<li>Using a pastry bag or a small sandwich bag with one corner snipped, drizzle the icing over the cooled cookies. Allow to set before packaging.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Note</p>
		<p>If desired, cookies can also be left without the added icing. The edges may also be rolled through granulated sugar before baking. These won't look "done" in a traditional cookie sense, but they will firm up as they cool.</p>
