		<!-- Description -->
		<p>Looking for something to do with that extra milk? Bored? Morbidly curious? This is how you make homemade cottage cheese.</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<!-- Pretty self explanatory; copy this line for each ingredient; the 'data-unit' is always singular -->
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="1" data-unit="gallon">1 gallon</span> skim milk, pasteurized</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="3/4" data-unit="cup">3/4 cup</span> white vinegar</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="1 1/2" data-unit="teaspoon">1 1/2 teaspoons</span> kosher salt</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="1/2" data-unit="cup">1/2 cup</span> heavy cream</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Pour the skim milk into a large saucepan and place over medium heat. Heat to 120 degrees F. Remove from the heat and gently pour in the vinegar. Stir slowly for 1 to 2 minutes. The curd will separate from the whey. Cover and allow to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
			<li>Pour the mixture into a colander lined with a tea towel and allow to sit and drain for 5 minutes. Gather up the edges of the cloth and rinse under cold water for 3 to 5 minutes or until the curd is completely cooled, squeezing and moving the mixture the whole time.</li>
			<li>Once cooled, squeeze as dry as possible and transfer to a mixing bowl. Add the salt and stir to combine, breaking up the curd into bite-size pieces as you go. If ready to serve immediately, stir in the half-and-half or heavy cream. If not, transfer to a sealable container and place in the refrigerator. Add the half and half or heavy cream just prior to serving.</li>
			<li>Also when serving: this is delicious with apple sauce, honey, raspberries, black pepper, or a whole bunch of other goodies.</li>
