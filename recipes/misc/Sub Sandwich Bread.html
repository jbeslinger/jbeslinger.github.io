		<!-- Description -->
		<p>Perfect homemade Subway bread recipe, just like the restaurant. This recipe makes a perfect copycat loaf of Subway bread for sandwiches at home.</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<!-- Pretty self explanatory; copy this line for each ingredient; the 'data-unit' is always singular -->
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="1" data-unit="cup">1 cup</span> warm water (like, 105°-110°)</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="1 1/2" data-unit="tablespoon">1 1/2 tablespoons</span> yeast</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="1" data-unit="tablespoon">1 tablespoon</span> sugar</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="1 1/2" data-unit="teaspoon">1 1/2 teaspoons</span> salt</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="4" data-unit="tablespoon">4 tablespoons</span> olive oil</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="2 1/2" data-unit="cup">2 1/2 cups</span> all-purpose flour</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>In the bowl of your stand mixer, add the water, yeast, sugar, salt, and olive oil. Let the mixture stand for 5 minutes.</li>
			<li>Add 1 cup of flour and mix with the dough hook for 3 to 5 minutes. Add an additional cup of flour and mix until well combined. Continue adding the flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until a soft dough is formed. The dough should still stick to the bottom of of the bowl, but pull away from the sides. Let the dough mix for around 8 minutes total.</li>
			<li>When the dough has come together but is still sticking a bit to the bottom of the bowl, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. The dough should be very soft. Shape the dough into a ball and return it to the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise for a half hour.</li>
			<li>After the dough has risen, turn it out onto a clean surface and divide it into 4. Roll each piece of dough into a long skinny loaf that is about 9 to 10 inches long.</li>
			<li>Place the rolled loaves onto a baking sheet lined with parchment or a baking mat. Repeat with the rest of the dough. Allow at least 2 inches between each loaf on the pan.</li>
			<li>Cover the loaves with a greased piece of plastic wrap and allow the loaves to rise until doubled, about an hour.</li>
			<li>Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. When the loaves are ready, bake them in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
			<li>When the loaves come out of the oven, rub the tops with a stick of butter and cover them with a dish towel to cool.</li>
			<li>Let the loaves cool for at least 30 minutes before cutting down the middle and topping with your favorite sandwich fixings.</li>
