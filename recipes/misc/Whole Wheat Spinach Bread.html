		</ul>

		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Thaw and squeeze out as much moisture from the spinach as you can.</li>
			<li>Put the spinach, water, yeast, sugar, salt, olive oil, onion powder, garlic powder, and whole wheat flour in the bowl of your stand mixer and mix well for 5 minutes (feel free to use a hand mixer if you have one).</li>
			<li>Scrape down the sides a few times, as needed. Add the all-purpose flour a half cup at a time until the dough starts to pull from the sides.</li>
			<li>Continue to mix the dough for another 5 to 8 minutes. After the dough has been mixed, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it by hand until the dough is no longer sticky to the touch, adding more flour as needed. The dough should be smooth and elastic.</li>
			<li>Form the dough into a smooth ball and place on a lightly floured board and cover it with a clean tea towel.</li>
			<li>Allow the dough to double in size, about 45 minutes.</li>
			<li>After the dough has doubled, divide it into two equal parts. Shape into round or long french bread-style loaves (as many as you specified in the "makes" section.</li>
			<li>Place the loaves on a large baking sheet that has been lined with parchment paper.</li>
			<li>Cover with a towel and allow the loaves to rise until almost doubled, about one hour.</li>
			<li>While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 400°.</li>
			<li>When the loaves are ready, using a very sharp knife cut 1/2 inch deep slashes along the top every few inches.</li>
			<li>Place the bread in the oven and cook for 40-50 minutes until the bread is deep brown and sounds hollow when tapped.</li>
			<li>Remove from oven and allow to cool on a wire rack before slicing.</li>
