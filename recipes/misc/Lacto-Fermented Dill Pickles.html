		<!-- Description -->
		<p>Spooky closet pickles; but they're delicious AND a probiotic.</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<!-- Pretty self explanatory; copy this line for each ingredient; the 'data-unit' is always singular -->
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="" data-unit="">2 pounds</span> pickling cucumbers</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="" data-unit="">6 cups</span> filtered water</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="" data-unit="">2 tablespoons</span> sea salt</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="" data-unit="">8 cloves</span> garlic, sliced</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="" data-unit="">2 teaspoons</span> peppercorns</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="" data-unit="">2 heads</span> fresh dill</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="" data-unit="">3 leaves</span> bay</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Rinse the cucumbers and place in an ice-water bath.</li>
			<li>Warm up one cup of the water on the stove, and stir in all the salt until dissolved. Let cool to room temp. Mix this cup with the remaining  5 cups water. You will end up with 2.5% saltwater brine.</li>
			<li>In a large, clean two quart jar, layer the cucumbers, garlic slices, fresh dill sprigs, bay leaves and all the whole spices.</li>
			<li>Pour the salt water brine over top, leaving an inch of headroom.</li>
			<li>Weigh down the cucumbers if need be, so they are submerged under the brine. (Use a fermentation weight, or a small ziplock back with a little water in it, or a sterilized river stone-see notes. ). Place a lid on it, loosely tightened. Place in a pan or bowl to collect any overflow and leave it in a cool dark place for 3-7 days (a basement, or lower kitchen cupboard).</li>
			<li>After 3 days, check for signs of life: bubbles, clouding.  Tap the jar, and see if tiny bubbles rise to the top. I usually ferment for 5 days. Longer ferments will yield tangier pickles. They also get softer as they ferment, so if you go too long, you’ll lose the crispness. Up to you. You can taste them at any point after you see bubbles, and ferment longer if you like.  Once you see active bubbles, you can at this point place the jar in the fridge, where it will continue to ferment, but much more slowly. Keep the pickles submerged.</li>
			<li>Once chilled, give them taste. They should be crispy and flavorful with a little tang. (At this point, if you want a tangier or softer pickle, you can absolutely pull them back out again and ferment for a few more days longer if you want.)</li>
			<li>If you like a fizzy brine, tighten the lid, burping every week or so. If you don’t want to think about it, give the lid one loose twist, so it’s on there, but gases can escape.</li>
