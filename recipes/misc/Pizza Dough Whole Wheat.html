		<!-- Description -->
		<p>Soft & chewy, whole wheat.  Keeps you regular if you're blocked up and adds a unique texture to the pizza.  Yields two 12-inch pizzas and freezes well.</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<!-- Pretty self explanatory; copy this line for each ingredient; the 'data-unit' is always singular -->
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="1/2" data-unit="teaspoon">1/2 teaspoon</span> granulated sugar</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="1/2" data-unit="cup">1/2 tablespoon</span> yeast</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="1 1/2" data-unit="cup">1 1/2 cups</span> warm water (105-115°)</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="2" data-unit="tablespoon">2 tablespoons</span> butter, frozen and chopped (or olive oil)</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="3" data-unit="cup">3 cups</span> whole wheat flour</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>In a large mixer bowl, combine the sugar, yeast, and warm water.  Mix and let sit until the yeast is foamy and dissolved (5 minutes).  Add salt to taste.  Mix by hand or with a mixer + dough hooks for 30 seconds.  Add the whole wheat flour and mix even further until the dough starts to come together.</li>
			<li>Once mixed, knead for 5 minutes by hand on a lightly floured surface.  If the dough is too wet, add up to 1/3 cup more flour.  After kneading, the dough should be smooth and elastic; springy to the touch.</li>
			<li>Shape dough into a ball and place into a well oiled mixing bowl.  Cover and allow to rise in a warm environment (75-80°).</li>
			<li>In 1-2 hours, your dough should have doubled in size (depending on your type of yeast).  Punch the dough in the face to release the air (majorly satisfying).  Cut the dough into two.</li>
			<li>Done!  Form into pizza crusts and make pizza.</li>
