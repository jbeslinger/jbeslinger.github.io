		<!-- Description -->
		<p>Even if you aren't usually a fan of hot sauce, I think you may change your mind after trying this fermented hot sauce recipe! The lacto-fermentation process transforms the sharp, hot, often overpowering flavor profile of chili peppers – into something far more mild, complex, flavorful, tangy and tasty than any other preparation of peppers! This is called a “sweet and spicy” fermented hot sauce because it is made with a combination of both hot chilis and sweet peppers. Therefore, you can easily tailor it to your taste buds with the types of peppers you choose to ferment.</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<!-- Pretty self explanatory; copy this line for each ingredient; the 'data-unit' is always singular -->
			<p>Equipment</p>
			<li>Fermentation vessel, such as a glass jar</li>
			<li>Ferment weight and airlock lid</li>
			<li>Strainer</li>
			<li>Blender</li>
			<li>Bottles or jars, for storage</li>

			<p>Ingredients</p>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="" data-unit="">1 lb</span> peppers of choice, both hot chili peppers and some sweeter peppers recommended</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="" data-unit="">1/2 cup</span> fresh cilantro, loosely packed</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="" data-unit="">1</span> onion, or 1/2 that of large onion</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="" data-unit="">2-3 cloves</span> garlic</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="" data-unit="">1 tbsp</span> sea salt, pickling salt, or kosher salt (no table salt)</li>
			<li><span class="ingredient" data-quantity="" data-unit="">2 cups</span> filtered water, to combine with salt for brine</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Wash and chop peppers and onions. Wear gloves is suggested. Remove most of pepper seeds.</li>
			<li>In the bottom of a clean quart jar, add a small handful (1/4 cup loose) of fresh cilantro and 2-3 crushed cloves of garlic.</li>
			<li>Next add the diced onion, and some peppers on top. Lightly press to compact and reduce air space as you go.</li>
			<li>When the jar is halfway to 2/3 full, add the remaining 1/4 cup of cilantro and then continue filling the jar with peppers, until completely packed full (within top inch of the jar).</li>
			<li>On the stovetop, combine 2 cups filtered water with 1 tbsp sea salt. Lightly heat until salt dissolves, but avoid over heating.</li>
			<li>Allow brine to cool to room temperature or lukewarm, and then pour over the peppers in the jar until the jar is full and they are fully submerged. Tap and wiggle jar to remove air pockets.</li>
			<li>Cover with fermentation weight and airlock lid, to keep veggies submerged below the brine during fermentation.</li>
			<li>Set jar in a temperate location (70-75°F) to ferment for 7-14 days.</li>
			<li>After 7-14 days, open jar and pour contents through a strainer that is positioned over a bowl to catch the liquid. KEEP the strained brine liquid.</li>
			<li>Add all solid contents (peppers, onions, garlic, and cilantro) to a blender. Add 1 tablespoon of fresh squeezed lime juice, and 1/4 cup of the reserved brine liquid. Blend.</li>
			<li>Assess the consistency of the fermented hot sauce. Continue to add reserved brine little by little, blending as you go, until the desired consistency of sauce is reached.</li>
			<li>Store finished fermented hot sauce in an air-tight bottle or jar in the refrigerator. Shake before use. It should stay good for up to one year in the refrigerator.</li>
